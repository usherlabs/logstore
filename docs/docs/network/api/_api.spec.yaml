        ```

        The **Retrieve Data** endpoint fetches data from a specific stream partition using three types of queries: **`last`**, **`from`**, **`range`**. The exact data returned can be customized using query parameters:

        - **`format`** to specify response data format, which can be **`protocol`**, **`object`**, or **`raw`**.
        - **`version`** to define the version of the data to retrieve.
        - Additional parameters like **`count`**, **`fromTimestamp`**, **`fromSequenceNumber`**, **`toTimestamp`**, **`toSequenceNumber`**, **`publisherId`**, and **`msgChainId`** to narrow down the data based on the chosen query type.

        The endpoint is secured with Basic Authentication, and improper authentication results in a '401 Unauthorized' response. The responses can be in either **`application/json`** or **`text/plain`** format, depending on the chosen **`format`**.
